int main(){
    int n;
    cout<<"Enter the number of students";
    cin>>n;
    
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>,greater<int>> minHeap;  here change only
    
    cout<<"Enter the marks obtained by the students:"<<endl;
    
    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
        int marks;
        cin>>marks;
        minHeap.push(marks);
    }
    
    int minMark = minHeap.top();
    
    cout<<"The maximum marks obtained are: "<<minMark<<endl;
}
